# LuminusEngine
A Game engine based on the luminus library


Ya know, It ALWAYS starts as a fun project of mine and now it has ended up been a actual project in working on daily. This engine is based on vector graphics so when i actually sit my ass down and make a compiler for the projects the can be upscaled to any resolution, Big or small (as they say.... size doesn't matter)
